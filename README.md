# My Coding System

**Stop guessing. Start engineering.**

A complete development methodology that turns AI from an unpredictable autocomplete into a disciplined engineering partner. Built for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), powered by the PIV Loop, and battle-tested across real projects.

## The Problem

AI coding tools are powerful, but without structure they produce inconsistent results. Give the AI too little context and it guesses. Give it too much and it drowns. Ask it to build a feature without a plan and you get code that works in isolation but breaks everything around it.

Most developers use AI like a magic 8-ball: ask a question, hope for a good answer, and manually clean up when it isn't.

**This system fixes that.**

It manages context automatically, enforces a plan-first workflow, and gives you quality gates at every stage. The result: AI that produces production-grade code on the first try, not the fifth.

---

## What This Is (and Isn't)

This is **not** an application. There's no source code, no build system, no runtime.

This is a **development methodology** — a structured collection of slash commands, templates, reference guides, and automation that wraps around Claude Code and turns it into a reliable development workflow. You clone this system, then build your applications inside it (or copy it into existing projects).

**What you get:**
- 21 slash commands that automate every phase of development
- 19 templates for plans, PRDs, agents, and validation reports
- 26 reference guides loaded on-demand (not wasting context tokens)
- 12 pre-built AI subagents for research, code review, and specialist tasks
- 5 cloud skills for parallel implementation and GitHub automation
- 3 GitHub Action workflows for AI-assisted issue resolution
- A token-conscious architecture that keeps <10K tokens of system context, leaving the rest for your actual work

## The PIV Loop

Every feature follows the same cycle: **Plan**, **Implement**, **Validate**, then iterate.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "PIV Loop"
        P["PLAN<br/>/planning"] --> I["IMPLEMENT<br/>/execute"]
        I --> V["VALIDATE<br/>/code-review"]
        V -->|"Issues?"| P
        V -->|"Pass"| C["/commit"]
    end

    P -.->|"produces"| PLAN["requests/feature-plan.md"]
    PLAN -.->|"feeds"| I
    V -.->|"if issues"| FIX["/code-review-fix"]
    FIX -.-> V
```

**Plan** — Start with a vibe planning conversation, then distill it into a structured plan document (500-700 lines of context-rich implementation instructions). The plan captures everything the AI needs: architecture decisions, file paths, code patterns, gotchas, and step-by-step tasks.

**Implement** — Execute the plan in a fresh conversation. Clean context means better output. The AI follows the plan task-by-task instead of improvising.

**Validate** — Code review, testing, and human review. Issues loop back to planning. A 5-level validation pyramid catches problems from syntax errors to architectural violations.

The key insight: **multiple small PIV loops** — one feature slice per loop, built completely before moving on. Complex features auto-decompose into sub-plans.

---

## System Architecture

Context is organized in layers. Auto-loaded context stays minimal so the AI has maximum context window for actual work. Deep guides load on-demand only when relevant.

```mermaid
graph TD
    CLAUDE["CLAUDE.md<br/>~2K tokens auto-loaded"] --> S["sections/<br/>6 core rules"]
    CLAUDE -.->|"on-demand"| R["reference/<br/>26 deep guides"]
    CLAUDE -.->|"on-demand"| T["templates/<br/>19 templates"]

    CMD[".claude/commands/<br/>21 slash commands"] -->|"reads"| T
    CMD -->|"produces"| REQ["requests/<br/>feature plans"]

    SK[".claude/skills/<br/>5 cloud skills"] -.->|"loads"| R

    MEM["memory.md<br/>cross-session context"] -.-> CMD
    ARCHON["Archon MCP<br/>(optional) task mgmt + RAG"] -.-> CMD

    REQ -->|"/execute"| IMPL["Implementation"]
    IMPL -->|"/commit"| GIT["Git Save Points"]
```

### Token Budget

The system manages context tokens carefully:

| Layer | Token Cost | Loading |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` + 6 sections | ~2K tokens | Auto-loaded every session |
| Slash commands | varies | Loaded only when invoked |
| Reference guides (26) | varies | On-demand only |
| Templates (19) | varies | On-demand only |
| **Typical session total** | **<10K tokens** | Leaves ~100K+ for implementation |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed
- Git configured

### Setup

1. **Clone** this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryanjosebrosas/my-coding-system-claude.git
   cd my-coding-system-claude
   ```

2. **Create your memory file** from the template:
   ```bash
   cp templates/MEMORY-TEMPLATE.md memory.md
   ```

3. **Start Claude Code** and prime the system:
   ```bash
   claude
   > /prime
   ```

4. **Plan your first feature**:
   ```
   > /planning user-authentication
   ```

5. **Execute the plan** (in a fresh session for clean context):
   ```
   > /execute requests/user-authentication-plan.md
   ```

6. **Review and commit**:
   ```
   > /code-review
   > /commit
   ```

### First Time?
Start with `/prime` to load context, then try `/planning` on a small feature. Read `reference/file-structure.md` for a full map of everything included.

---

## Adopting for Your Project

### Option A: Use as Your Project Base (Recommended for new projects)
Fork or clone this repo, then build your application inside it. All slash commands, templates, and reference guides are ready to go.

### Option B: Copy Into an Existing Project
```bash
cp -r sections/ reference/ templates/ requests/ your-project/
cp CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md .coderabbit.yaml your-project/
cp -r .claude/ your-project/
cp templates/MEMORY-TEMPLATE.md your-project/memory.md
```

Then run `/init-c` to customize `CLAUDE.md` for your project's tech stack.

### After Setup
- `memory.md` — Created from template, gitignored. Each developer maintains their own.
- `requests/*.md` — Feature plans, gitignored. Ephemeral by design.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — Personal Claude Code settings, gitignored.

---

## Model Strategy

The system separates thinking from doing. Use the right model for each phase:

| Phase | Recommended Model | Why |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| `/planning` | **Opus** (`claude --model opus`) | Deep reasoning produces better plans |
| `/execute` | **Sonnet** (`claude` default) | Balanced — follows plans well at lower cost |
| `/code-review` | **Haiku** (via subagents) | Pattern matching at a fraction of the cost |
| `/commit`, `/prime` | **Sonnet** (`claude` default) | General-purpose tasks |

```bash
# Planning session (Opus for deep reasoning)
claude --model opus
> /planning my-feature

# Execution session (Sonnet for focused implementation)
claude
> /execute requests/my-feature-plan.md
```

See `reference/multi-model-strategy.md` for the full cost optimization guide.

## Agent Teams

For features too complex for a single Claude instance, Agent Teams coordinates multiple instances with **contract-first spawning** — upstream agents publish interfaces before downstream agents start building.

```bash
# Plan the feature (Opus recommended for deep reasoning)
claude --model opus
> /planning my-feature

# Execute with a coordinated team (Sonnet recommended for speed)
> /team requests/my-feature-plan.md
```

The system handles team sizing, task decomposition, spawn prompts, and WSL+tmux orchestration automatically. See `reference/agent-teams-overview.md` for the full architecture.

---

## GitHub Automation

### Included Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What It Does |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `claude-fix.yml` | `@claude-fix` comment on issue/PR | AI investigates and fixes the issue on a branch |
| `coderabbit-approval-notify.yml` | CodeRabbit approves a PR | Notifies when automated review passes |
| `coderabbit-auto-merge.yml` | CodeRabbit submits review | Auto-merges PRs that pass automated review |

### 8 Workflow Prompt Templates

Pre-built prompts in `.github/workflows/prompts/` that give GitHub Actions Claude instances the same structured methodology:

`prime-github.md` | `plan-feature-github.md` | `execute-github.md` | `rca-github.md` | `implement-fix-github.md` | `bug-fix-github.md` | `code-review-github.md` | `end-to-end-feature-github.md`

### Setup

1. Add `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to repo secrets
2. Add `AUTHORIZED_USERS` as a repository variable: `["your-username"]`
3. Copy workflows to `.github/workflows/`
4. Optionally configure `.coderabbit.yaml` for automated PR reviews

See `reference/github-integration.md` for the full setup guide, or run `/setup-github-automation` for automated configuration.

---

## Context Engineering: The 4 Pillars

Every structured plan is built on four pillars that ensure the AI has exactly what it needs:

| Pillar | What It Provides | Plan Section |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Memory** | Past decisions and gotchas from `memory.md` | Related Memories |
| **RAG** | External docs, library references, codebase patterns | Relevant Documentation, Patterns to Follow |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Explicit decisions, step-by-step detail, reduced ambiguity | Solution Statement, Implementation Plan |
| **Task Management** | Atomic tasks with files, actions, and validation criteria | Step-by-Step Tasks |

The balance matters. Too little context and the AI guesses wrong. Too much and it loses focus. The structured plan template (`templates/STRUCTURED-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md`) enforces this balance by mapping each pillar to specific sections.

---

## Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|-------------|
| **YAGNI** | Only implement what's needed right now. No speculative features. |
| **KISS** | Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever abstractions. |
| **DRY** | Extract common patterns, but don't over-abstract. |
| **Limit AI Assumptions** | Be explicit in plans and prompts. Less guessing = better output. |
| **Always Be Priming (ABP)** | Start every session with `/prime`. Context is everything. |

---

## Optional: Archon MCP

[Archon MCP](https://github.com/coleam00/archon) provides task management and RAG search across sessions. **Completely optional** — all commands work without it. When available, it adds:

- Persistent task tracking across planning and execution sessions
- RAG search over curated documentation sources
- Project and version management

See `reference/archon-workflow.md` for setup instructions.
