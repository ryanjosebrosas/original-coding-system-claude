# Planning Phases

## Phase 0: Discovery

**Goal**: Collaboratively discover scope.

**Activities**:
- Understand user's technical level
- Ask probing questions
- Suggest approaches with trade-offs
- Scope negotiation

**Exit**: User confirms scope

## Phase 1: Scoping

**Goal**: Define feature metadata.

**Output**:
- User Story
- Problem Statement
- Solution Statement
- Feature Metadata (type, complexity, dependencies)

## Phase 2-3: Research

**Goal**: Gather intelligence.

Launch 4 parallel agents:
- Agent A: Similar implementations
- Agent B: Project patterns
- Agent C: External docs
- Agent D: Best practices

## Phase 4-7: Synthesis

Design, validate, output.
