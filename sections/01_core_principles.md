1. **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
   - Only implement what's needed right now
   - No premature optimization or future-proofing

2. **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
   - Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever abstractions

3. **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - Extract common patterns when appropriate
   - But don't over-abstract — balance with YAGNI

4. **Limit AI Assumptions**
   - Be explicit in plans and prompts
   - The less the AI guesses, the better the output
