**Proceed autonomously when:**
- Task is clear from context
- Following established patterns
- Implementation plan is explicit

**Ask the user when:**
- Requirements are ambiguous
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Breaking changes are needed
- Business logic decisions required

If unsure, ask.

**NEVER use EnterPlanMode.**
Planning is done through `/planning` (the slash command), which produces a structured plan document in `requests/`. The built-in plan mode tool bypasses our methodology — don't use it.
