# Baseline Assessment

> Use this template to measure your PIV Loop improvement over time.
> Complete it BEFORE starting the system (baseline) and AFTER completing core guides (comparison).
> Track the same feature both times for a valid comparison.
>
> **Core Principle**: The system works if all five categories improve together.
> If time decreased but confidence dropped, you optimized for speed, not quality.

## Honest Self-Assessment Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] I worked at normal pace (not rushing or overthinking)
- [ ] I tracked time accurately (with breaks excluded)
- [ ] I counted all prompts (including follow-ups)
- [ ] I rated confidence realistically (not inflated)
- [ ] I documented all issues (not just major ones)
- [ ] This is a real feature, not a toy problem
- [ ] I would be comfortable sharing these numbers

If any checkbox is uncertain, re-run the assessment.

## Improvement Comparison

> Fill this section only on the Post-System assessment.

| Category | Before (Baseline) | After (Post-System) | Change |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Total time | ___ min | ___ min | {target: 30-50% reduction} |
| Number of prompts | ___ | ___ | {target: 40-60% fewer} |
| Avg confidence | ___ /10 | ___ /10 | {target: +2-3 points} |
| Debugging cycles | ___ | ___ | {target: fewer} |
| Quality signals passing | ___ /4 | ___ /4 | {target: 4/4} |

**Expected improvements**: Time 30-50% less, prompts 40-60% fewer, confidence +2-3 points, fewer bugs.
